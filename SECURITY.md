# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability (preferred)
Please use one of the following channels to report security issues:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (recommended)
   - Open the repository, go to the "Security" tab → "Advisories" → "Report a vulnerability".
   - This creates a private, coordinated disclosure workflow.

2. If the advisories feature is not available, open a GitHub Issue with the label `security` and mark it confidential, or use the repository's "Report a vulnerability" link if present.

3. For sensitive reports, email the maintainers at: CarnegieJ@IAYFconsulting.com
   - If you email, please encrypt sensitive information using our PGP key (if available) or attach safe reproduction steps.

Include the following in your report:
- Affected version(s)
- Clear description of the issue and expected behavior
- Reproduction steps or a minimal proof-of-concept
- Impact assessment (data exposure, privilege escalation, etc.)
- Any suggested mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up

## Response Process & Timeline
- Acknowledgement: We aim to acknowledge all valid reports within 3 business days.
- Initial triage: We will triage and classify severity within 7 calendar days.
- Resolution: Timeline for fixes depends on severity. Critical issues will be prioritized and patched as soon as feasible.
- Updates: We will provide status updates at least weekly until resolved.
- CVE: We will coordinate CVE requests for applicable vulnerabilities.

---

## Disclosure Policy
- Please do not publicly disclose details of a security issue until a patch or mitigation is released.
- Responsible disclosure is appreciated — public disclosure before a fix may lead to delayed support for affected users.

---

## After a Fix
- We will publish release notes describing the fix and affected versions.
- Users are advised to upgrade to a supported patched version as soon as practical.

---

## Contact & Escalation
- Primary channel: GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Fallback: CarnegieJ@IAYFconsulting.com

If you need a faster response or have escalation requirements, include "URGENT" in the subject line and provide your preferred contact method.
